We have a new place, we have a new site, the only important thing left in our list was a coffee machine.

One of our members had a [nespresso] machine with a leak problem so we decided to take it apart and look into the issue.

After opening it (luckly enough this machine had standard screws) we discover that a sealing rubber had lost its shape a little bit and water was leaking
through there. So we put our plummer hats own and decided to use [teflon tape] to add more pressure thus compensating the new shape of the ring.

This is the result:

After that, the machine is now leak-free and fully functional.

Now that we know how the machine works we will be mooding it further by adding some functionalities only available in superior models.

Cheers and happy hacking!
